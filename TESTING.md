The approaches I've been helping you with revolve during testing:

Rendering and Initial State: Testing whether the component renders correctly without throwing any errors. This includes verifying if all expected elements (like buttons, inputs, text, etc.) are present and if the component is in the correct initial state.

User Interactions: Simulating user interactions such as clicking buttons, typing in input fields, submitting forms, etc., and then verifying the expected outcomes. This could be changes in the component's state, calls to functions (like event handlers), or changes in the rendered output.

Prop Handling and Component Behavior: Testing how the component handles props and whether it behaves correctly when props change. This includes testing conditional rendering based on props and ensuring that the component updates as expected when props change.

Function Calls and Side Effects: Ensuring that functions (especially callbacks passed as props) are called at the right time and with the right arguments. If the component has side effects (like API calls, timers, or direct DOM manipulations), tests may mock these and verify they're executed correctly.

State Management and Updates: Testing the internal state management logic of the component. This involves simulating events that should change the state and verifying that the state updates correctly.
